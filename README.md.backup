# Conditional Statements in Python

Frequenly, a program needs to skip over some statements, executea series of statements repetitively, or choose between alternate sets of statements to execute.

That is where **control structures** come in. A control structure directs the order of execution of the statements in a program(referred to as the program's flow).

## Introduction to the if Statement

We'll start by looking at the most basic type of if statement. In its simplest form, it look like this:

```
if <expr>:
	<statement>
```

In the form shown above:

- 'expr' is an expression evaluated in a Boolean context.
- 'statement' is a valid Python statement, which must be indented.

Note that the colon(:) following 'expr' is required.
